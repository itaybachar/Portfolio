aboutMe = "My name is Itay Bachar and I am a self-taught software engineer. I am currently working towards a B.S in Computer Science at NJIT. I started my coding career when I was 14 when I first programmed some video game hacks using C++. After a few years of C++, I taught myself Java and have been using it to create many of my recent programs. What I believe sets me apart from the crowd is that I am a motivated self-learner. I always want to learn more about different fields of Computer Science and I never give up until I achieve my goals. I always strive to gain knowledge about modern technologies and to incorporate them into my own projects. I focus on back-end development but I have a basic knowledge in front-end development and I intend on advancing it in the future. Computer science is my passion and I hope to devote my future education and career to the field."
