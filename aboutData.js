aboutMe = "Hello, My name is Itay Bachar and I am currently a high school senior at Tenafly High School. I started my coding career when I was 14 in which I programmed some video game hacks using C++. After a few years of C++ I learned Java and have been using it to create most of my recent programs. What I believe sets me apart from the crowd is that I am a motivated self-learner. This means I can motivate myself and teach myself anything my heart desires(I have not failed at this yet). I always want to learn more about different fields and I never give up until I reach my goals. I am willing to learn any language a job may require and I am more interested in backend development. I have some basic knowledge on front end development which I intend on advance."
